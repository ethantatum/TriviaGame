## Timed Questions
### This game shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
### If the player selects the correct answer, a message pops up congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds,  the next question displays.

### The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs. Each question also has a "bad" answer that generates a unique message!

### If the player runs out of time, there is a message that time's up.

### On the final screen, the player sees the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game.

## Have fun!
